# **App Name**: NeuroAI Health

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using Firebase Authentication.
- Spiral Test Analysis: Analyze spiral drawing data to detect potential Parkinson's indicators. Implements tremor, smoothness, speed and consistency calculations.
- Voice Test Analysis: Analyze user's voice recordings to identify potential vocal biomarkers of Parkinson's. In real implementation, the app uses simulated scores to make analysis work, by calculating volume, clarity, tremor and pitch, until an audio analysis tool is integrated.
- Tapping Test Analysis: Assess motor skills by analyzing tapping patterns. Measure metrics like speed, consistency, and rhythm to detect irregularities.
- Progress Tracking: Track user's test history and display progress data in charts. Show trends and statistics of users overall scores.
- Dashboard Visualization: A UI page providing at-a-glance overview of health indicators, test history, and progress trends.
- Report Generation: A feature allowing the user to create sharable PDF summaries of test results. The tool assists users in summarizing findings about their test results in report format.  

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E47CC) to convey trust and clinical precision.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#293549) for a clean, modern, professional feel.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#72D4FF) for highlighting key information and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, will be used in headlines and titles. Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for the body and descriptions to make content easy to read.
- Use consistent, modern icons from Lucide React library. Icons should be simple, and related to the test and its outcomes.
- The design consists of cards with soft corners and shadow for the results. Main layout uses left side bar for navigation and test/results details on the main page.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for UI elements. Animations on buttons and graphs with soft and fluid feel.
